1. Autocoder is a piece of code to generate code automatically, and then to run it! It takes the output from terminal and then puts it back to the prompt to help debug automatically. Beware, still buggy!
2. Coding compare is a way to look at code creation. GPT-3.5 does much better if you ask it to first create step by step instructions and then create code, to "prepare" so to speak and to think first. The examples are fun to see!
